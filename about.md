I’m working for VMware as a Staff Solutions Architect in the Global Cloud COE
(Center Of Excellence) Team.

I’m designing & implementing Cloud solutions based on VMware vCloud Director &
vSphere products for Service Providers. I have a solid background in computer
science, with strong emphasis in Virtualization/Cloud/Networking, and some
development/automation skills (#DevOps).
